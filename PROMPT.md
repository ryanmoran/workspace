# PROMPT

## Context

1. Read the AGENTS.md file for general repository context.

## Objective

Let's develop a new skill for writing a Technical Design Document (TDD).

There are 3 example TDDs mounted at the following locations:

- /tdd-1
- /tdd-2
- /tdd-3

Read these and use them as a mechanism for understanding how technical design
documents should be written.

TDDs have a common format they follow. As part of the skill, distill a common
template that can be used when writing a new TDD.

Model this new skill on the existing `brainstorming` skill. This skill is a
great example of how to interactively develop ideas with a user. It is
desirable that this new skill describe an interactive process with the user and
agent working together to develop the TDD.
